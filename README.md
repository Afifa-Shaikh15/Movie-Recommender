# Movie-Recommender
A Movie Recommender System is an intelligent application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences, past interactions, or similarities with other users. The goal is to enhance user experience by helping them discover movies they are likely to enjoy without manually searching through large catalogs.

The system typically uses one or more of the following approaches:

Content-Based Filtering

Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked in the past.

Uses features like genre, actors, directors, keywords, and descriptions.

Collaborative Filtering

Suggests movies by analyzing user behavior and preferences.

Example: Users who liked “Inception” also liked “Interstellar.”

Can be user-based (finding similar users) or item-based (finding similar movies).

Hybrid Approach

Combines content-based and collaborative methods for more accurate recommendations.

Addresses limitations like the "cold start problem" (when new users or movies have no data).

Key Features

Personalized movie recommendations.

Filtering by genre, language, or release year.

Ratings and feedback integration for continuous improvement.

Scalable to large datasets like IMDB, Netflix, or MovieLens.

Applications
